  "tagline": "",
  "body": "\r\n## Introduction\r\nPRESAGE is an open-source tool which is aimed at protecting structured address computations against soft errors. It is developed using [LLVM compiler infrastructure](http://llvm.org/). PRESAGE applies \r\na novel rewriting scheme, dubbed Relative Base Addressing (RBA) scheme, which introduces dependency chains between same-base-address-sharing GetElementPtr instructions at LLVM intermediate representation (IR) level. Currently, PRESAGE is extensively tested on C benchmarks drawn from [Polybench/C benchmark suite](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~pouchet/software/polybench/). However, it should work for any high-level language which can be compiled to LLVM IR. \r\n\r\n## People \r\n### Faculty & Collaborators\r\n* [Ganesh Gopalakrishnan](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~ganesh/)\r\n* [Sriram Krishnamoorthy](http://hpc.pnl.gov/people/sriram/)\r\n\r\n### Developers\r\n* [Vishal Sharma](https://sites.google.com/site/vishalutah/home)\r\n\r\n### PRESAGE Demo\r\n* [Visualizing the effect of the PRESAGE transformation.](http://formalverification.cs.utah.edu/fmr/presage/presage_viz.html)\r\n\r\n## Cite our work\r\nWhen you use PRESAGE in your research work, please cite our work using below citation information.
